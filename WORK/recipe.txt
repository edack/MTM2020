Of course! Vegetarian tacos are extremely versatile and can be made
with with any veggies youd like. Sweet potatoes and mushrooms would

Just keep in mind that your roasting time may vary depending on what
vegetables you add to these healthy tacos.

How to Warm Tortillas

You can warm tortillas for short bursts of time in the microwave,
or you can warm them in a dry skillet over medium-low heat.
Keep an eye on your tortillas, as they dont need much time to
heat through!

Tips for the Best Vegetarian Tacos

Dice all the veggies roughly the same size so they cook
at the same rate.

I diced the tomatoes a little larger, as they shrink in the oven.

Dont forget to squeeze some fresh lime juice over the tacos
before you eat them. The lime juice makes the flavors pop!

The taco filling reheats well the next day and can be made
into burrito, enchiladas, and more.
