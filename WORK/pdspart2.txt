You can warm tortillas for short bursts of time in the microwave,
or you can warm them in a dry skillet over medium-low heat.

Tips for the Best Vegetarian Tacos

Dice all the veggies roughly the same size so they cook
at the same rate.

I diced the tomatoes a little larger, as they shrink in the oven.

Dont forget to squeeze some fresh lime juice over the tacos
before you eat them. The lime juice makes the flavors pop!

The taco filling reheats well the next day and can be made
into burrito, enchiladas, and more.
